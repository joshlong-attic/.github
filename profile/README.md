## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

If you've found this page, then you found where I keep all my _old_ repositories of little note or interest, preserved for posterity. These are experiments, tests, sketches, forks whose time has come and gone, etc. My main Github organization is still over at [`joshlong`](https://github.com/joshlong).
